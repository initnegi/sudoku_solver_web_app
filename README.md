## ü§î What's a Sudoku Puzzle?  
A Sudoku puzzle is a number puzzle or logic game. The puzzle consists of a `9x9` grid, divided into nine `3x3` subgrids, also known as "regions" or "boxes." The objective of Sudoku is to fill in the entire grid with numbers so that each row, each column, and each `3x3` subgrid contains all of the digits from `1 to 9`, with **no repetition of numbers in any of these regions**.

## üìú Basic Rules :

1. Each row must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.

2. Each column must also contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.

3. Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.


## üìö How to Use the Solver

1. **Input Your Puzzle**: Enter the Sudoku puzzle by filling in the numbers in the grid. Use "0" or leave cells empty for unknown values.

2. **Click "Solve"**: Once you've input your puzzle, click the "Solve" button.

3. **View the Solution**: The solver will utilize the Backtracking algorithm to find a solution. Once solved, the completed puzzle will be displayed.

## üß∞ Solving with Backtracking

The Sudoku Solver employs the Backtracking algorithm to find solutions efficiently. Backtracking is a recursive technique that explores potential solutions and backtracks when it encounters inconsistencies, ultimately leading to a valid solution or indicating that no solution exists. This algorithm is particularly well-suited for solving Sudoku puzzles, as it efficiently explores the puzzle space and ensures the validity of each move.
